      "Tim called all his mom, and she came running with a cup of water. \"Don't touch this flame, Tim!\" she said. Tim didn't touch the flame, but he was safe, so he looked at the water and thought about how he helped out.\n",
      "Tim knew someone was right, so he decided to be a brave knight. He talked to his mom, who was very kind too. \"Can I help?\" Tim asked his mom, and she let him touch the flame. He felt proud, and his mom was proud of him.\n",
      "The moral of the story is: He learned that being brave is important, but being brave can make scary things happen.\n",
